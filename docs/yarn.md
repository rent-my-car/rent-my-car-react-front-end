   This is similar to using `npx create-react-app`.

   yarn install
   ```

   ```
   Adds a new package to your project and updates `package.json`.

4. **Remove a Dependency:**
   ```bash
   yarn remove <package-name>
   ```
   Removes a package from your project and updates `package.json`.

5. **Update Dependencies:**
